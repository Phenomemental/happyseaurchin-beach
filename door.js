/* door.js — the way in, made standard: a name, its key, and the card that keeps them.
 *
 * Lifted from David's sign-in for Community Recovery (community-recovery/kit.js and words.js,
 * copied here under the MIT licence below) into one door any of Matthew's pages can take. It wears
 * the page's own look: door.css reads the page's colour tokens (--ground, --ink, --muted, --panel,
 * --line, --accent, --serif) and falls back to Matthew's (look:Phenomemental).
 *
 *   <script>window.DOOR = { place, beach, home, room, key };</script>   all optional
 *   <script src="door.js"></script>
 *
 * place is printed on the card; beach is where names live (the main beach by default); home is the
 * page's address, printed on the card; room is where 'lost my words' sends a person; key is the
 * storage name this phone keeps them under.
 *
 * Two ways in. "I'm new": a name nobody on the beach already answers to (any block named for it,
 * not passports only, and without regard to capitals, spaces or hyphens, so no twin is ever made),
 * and three words the page proposes and shows once; the first write is passport:<name>, latched
 * with them. "I've been here": a name and its key. The key is tried exactly as typed first, then
 * as three words tidied the way the kit tidies them, because people already on the beach hold keys
 * of their own (ways:key 2). Names follow the beach's one rule for a handle: letters, digits, _ and
 * -, with one space between words.
 *
 * Words reach the beach as the beach's own voice puts them (beach.happyseaurchin.com/button/
 * voice.js, say): the person's mirror, <family>:<name>, founded latched to their key, then a plain
 * line at the address, so a voice given here reads the same on every page that reads the family.
 *
 * What a phone remembers is kept in its own storage and sent nowhere else. No key of anyone's is
 * ever written into a page.
